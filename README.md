# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard** is an end-to-end data analysis and visualization project built in **Microsoft Excel** using **Power Query**, **Power Pivot**, and **DAX**.
The dashboard provides actionable insights into hospital emergency room operations by tracking **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as patient volume, average wait times, and satisfaction scores.

This project simulates a **real-world hospital analytics scenario**, helping healthcare administrators make informed decisions to improve efficiency and patient care.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal was to create a **data-driven solution** for hospital management that:

* Improves efficiency by monitoring critical ER metrics.
* Provides clear, visual insights for stakeholders.
* Identifies patterns and bottlenecks in patient flow.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized records representing hospital ER visits, including:

* Patient demographics (age, gender)
* Admission status (Admitted / Not Admitted)
* Wait times (in minutes)
* Patient satisfaction scores
* Type of service received

---

## 📊 Key KPIs & Insights

* **Number of Patients:** Tracks total patient visits and identifies busy periods.
* **Average Wait Time:** Monitors service efficiency and highlights delays.
* **Patient Satisfaction Score:** Measures service quality over time.
* **Admission Status:** Analyzes admitted vs. non-admitted patients.
* **Demographics:** Breaks down patients by age group and gender.
* **Specialty Services:** Displays service demand by department.

If you want, I can also make this README **more visually appealing** by adding emojis, badges, and a **Table of Contents** so it looks highly professional on GitHub and attracts recruiters. That would make your repository stand out.

Do you want me to make that upgraded version?
